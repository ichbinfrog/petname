Petname is a server that generates unique petnames (see [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178)) which are pronounceable, sometimes even memorable names consisting of a random combination of adverbs, an adjective, and an animal name.

You can use this server to:
- Create unique memorable names for your container/processes
- (**future**) Dynamically import more names into the server
- (**future**) Distributed lightweight API server to handle unique cluster names
- (**future**) Securely access the API using Bearer Tokens
